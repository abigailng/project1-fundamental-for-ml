## Welcome to this little blog

Hello. It's nice to know you!

My name is Abigail Nguyen, a Vietnamese.

Vietnamese is my mother tongue, and English is my second language.

Why I created this blog:
- Summarize the main points of fundamentals for Machine Learning in understandable and systemetic ways.
- Practice writting English.

If I make any mistakes, I would really appreciate it if you would correct them.

Thank you so much for your support =)

Have a nice day =)
